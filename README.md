# *vectorscores*

*vectorscores* is a new series of dynamic compositions by John Teske. The scores are written algorithmically so the works as a whole are crafted but the details are unique for each performance.

John has been exploring ways to express complex ideas to musicians given limitations on rehearsal time, funding, and location. *vectorscores* uses web technology to create scores and parts for musicians that use animation to present musical material, generate and update parts in real-time, and allow a musician's choices to influence other players' parts.

*vectorscores* is iterative and transparent, with a public code repository and the latest progress published to the website. The project is a continual work in progress, with every rehearsal and performance helping the composer further shape the works and clarify notation.


## Advantages over traditional scores
- online access to scores via web browser
- use of animation
- tutorial function for education and to aid in rehearsal—useful when dealing with complex music, tight timelines and budgets, or the absence of the composer
- unique musical possibilities including: parts generated based on input, collaboration, realtime generation of musical material, etc.
- vector graphics can be scaled and manipulated without loss of quality


## How to Perform

### Server options
- View and perform the scores from [vectorscores.org](https://vectorscores.org/)
- Clone the repository and run a local webserver

### Viewing options
- View on any internet-enabled device
- When running locally, use a (W)LAN to serve the scores. By running the websockets server you can also perform scores with individual parts.
- Use a video splitter to view the same score on multiple screens
- Project the image for performers (projecting for the audience is less ideal in a concert setting)

## Contributing
- **Performances**. Perform works created with *vectorscores*. Contact me and I'll list performances here along with links to any audio and video documentation.
- **Compositions**. Use the *vectorscores* framework to compose your own score. You are welcome to use my work a starting point—but please make them your own!
- **Repository**. I encourage feedback and contributions to this project. Feel free to submit issues and pull requests!

## Roadmap

### Public access to works
- public-facing website
- open source repository
- clone or download repository to run on local machine or WLAN
- documentation of premiere performances and other performances as available
- download pre-selected vector files and pdfs of scores (TODO)
- download generated vector files and pdfs of scores (TODO)
