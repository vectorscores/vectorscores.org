<h1><em>vectorscores</em></h1>
<p><em>vectorscores</em> is a new series of dynamic compositions by John Teske. The scores are written algorithmically so the works as a whole are crafted but the details are unique for each performance.</p>
<p>John has been exploring ways to express complex ideas to musicians given limitations on rehearsal time, funding, and location. <em>vectorscores</em> uses web technology to create scores and parts for musicians that use animation to present musical material, generate and update parts in real-time, and allow a musician's choices to influence other players' parts.</p>
<p><em>vectorscores</em> is iterative and transparent, with a public code repository and the latest progress published to the website. The project is a continual work in progress, with every rehearsal and performance helping the composer further shape the works and clarify notation.</p>
<h2>Advantages over traditional scores</h2>
<ul>
<li>online access to scores via web browser</li>
<li>use of animation</li>
<li>tutorial function for education and to aid in rehearsal—useful when dealing with complex music, tight timelines and budgets, or the absence of the composer</li>
<li>unique musical possibilities including: parts generated based on input, collaboration, realtime generation of musical material, etc.</li>
<li>vector graphics can be scaled and manipulated without loss of quality</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to Perform</h2>
<h3>Server options</h3>
<ul>
<li>View and perform the scores from <a href="https://vectorscores.org/">vectorscores.org</a></li>
<li>Clone the repository and run a local webserver</li>
</ul>
<h3>Viewing options</h3>
<ul>
<li>View on any internet-enabled device</li>
<li>When running locally, use a (W)LAN to serve the scores. By running the websockets server you can also perform scores with individual parts.</li>
<li>Use a video splitter to view the same score on multiple screens</li>
<li>Project the image for performers (projecting for the audience is less ideal in a concert setting)</li>
</ul>
